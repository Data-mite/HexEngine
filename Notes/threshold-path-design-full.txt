The Threshold Path is a liminal space between worlds. It connects portals, not fixed locations—each traversal may lead to a different world unless an intentional return is enacted. Within the Path, geography is procedurally generated using structured rules: cube-based in tight liminal sequences, hex-based in broader reality spaces.Cube Model (Liminal Zones)- Applies when traveling between portals without stepping into anchored worldspace.- Navigation occurs within a conceptual WorldCube, bounded and persistent.- Cubes may contain landmarks, micro-realities, or narrative set pieces.- Exits: forward/backward, left/right, up/down. Often only one non-entry exit is available.- Transitions between cubes may change tone, logic, or physics.Hex Model (World Zones)- Activated upon entering a world via portal.- World is structured as a hex grid, with the path cutting through hexes.- At least one ring of hexes is generated around the current position for visibility.- Path exits are sometimes visible, sometimes hidden; not always accessible to native inhabitants.- The emotional state of the Circle may influence hex content (encounters, portals, skybox).Encounter Logic- Each hex or cube entered triggers a random encounter roll.- Adjacent nodes (hexes or cubes) may display visible events or entities.- Encounters may be emotional, environmental, or narrative in structure.Path Properties- The Path is always good footing—navigable, safe from terrain instability.- Though liminal, the Path is frequently traversed by denizens of nearby worlds for trade or travel.- It may appear as a literal path, road, river, leyline, or light corridor depending on the current realm’s nature.Portals- Portals are anchored within worldspaces.- Some portals have long paths between them; others are brief.- Emotional resonance may affect portal activation or redirection.Special Mechanics- Emotional registers may gate certain exits or alter world generation.- Some realms have unique traversal rules (e.g., reverse cause/effect, dream logic).- Branching paths are rare, but possible; forks usually offer two or three options.Unsettled Questions- Do non-player entities have access to the Path’s deeper logic?- Can portals decay, shift, or be sealed?- How much influence does intent vs. emotional state have on destination?Canon Status- Discussed and accepted in principle.- Now sealed in Chronicle.- Logged with canonical tags for procedural and narrative traversal logic.Compiled from live design notes during extended Circle session.
