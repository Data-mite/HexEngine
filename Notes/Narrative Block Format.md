**Threshold Path: Narrative Block Format**

Each generated hex in the Threshold Path should be rendered using this structured narrative format. This format prioritizes immersive, symbolic, and mythically resonant language while clearly orienting the player within the space.

---

### \[Hex Title – evocative and symbolic]

\[Three to five lines of narrative description. This description should reflect the biome, terrain, feature, and mood without quoting them directly unless dramatically justified. The tone should be mythic, reflective, and charged with symbolic potential.]

* **Exits:**

  * `[Direction] - (Back) [Previous Landmark]` *(if applicable)*
  * `[Direction] - [Terrain] [Feature Summary]`

**Examples**

### The Echo That Listens

You emerge onto a path not built, but declared—each step etched in resonance, each breath stirring the veil.
Symbols hover in the air like waiting ears, trembling to hear your voice.
This is not a road but a dialogue, a causeway where meaning reveals itself in ripples, not words.
A hush of **Sacred Anticipation** pervades—the quiet that comes before the ritual begins.

* **Exits:**

  * `SW - (Back) The Sanctum`
  * `NE - Riverbank [Tangle of vines catching river breath]`

This format must be applied to every generated hex. Use plain markdown. Maintain tone consistency with ritual prose and atmospheric world-building.
