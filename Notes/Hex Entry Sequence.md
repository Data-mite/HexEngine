**Threshold Path â€“ Hex Entry Sequence (v2)**

This document defines the step-by-step protocol for generating a new hex upon entry within the Threshold Path.

### ðŸ§­ Hex Entry Sequence

1. Receive **entry direction** (from previous hex's exit)
2. **Pick one exit direction**, excluding the entry direction
3. **Check for forks**:

   * Roll d10
   * If result is 1, create a fork
4. If fork, **assign a new direction** (excluding used ones), then:

   * Roll d10 again
   * Repeat step 4 on result of 1 (max 7 exits total)
5. Create **Hex ID**
6. Apply **biome, terrain, and feature** (using continuity logic)
7. Repeat steps 1â€“6 for **each forward hex** at all exits (excluding entrance)
8. **Terrain** matches previous hex with 90% probability
9. **Feature** matches previous hex with 75% probability
10. Generate **narrative title and prose** (based on symbolic synthesis)
11. Display **exit list** beneath the narrative block, labeled by compass direction

This sequence ensures each hex retains logical continuity while enabling symbolic divergence and rare branching. All forward paths must be resolved in advance of entry.
